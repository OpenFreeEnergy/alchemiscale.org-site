In February, we published the **alchemiscale** project's [2025 roadmap]({{< ref "/roadmaps/alchemiscale-2025" >}}), detailing our objectives for the year, our available resources, and the path we intend to take to leverage these resources in service to those objectives.

We are pleased to announce support from [Achira](https://achira.ai/) for [Datryllic](https://datryllic.com/)'s continued open source advancement of [**alchemiscale**](https://alchemiscale.org), enabling the coordination of massively-scalable free energy calculation campaigns within the [Open Free Energy Consortium](https://openfree.energy) software ecosystem.
[Achira](https://achira.ai/) is developing atomistic foundation simulation models for drug discovery.
