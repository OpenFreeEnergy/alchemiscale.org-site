In October, we offered a detailed perspective on what we considered to be the **alchemiscale** project's most attractive [advancement opportunities in 2025]({{< ref "/opportunities/alchemiscale-2025" >}}).
This perspective functioned as a call to action, since delivering on these advancements requires us to marshal the [resources]({{< ref "/opportunities/alchemiscale-2025#how-do-we-do-it" >}}) to do them.

We are pleased to report that [**ASAP Discovery**](https://asapdiscovery.org/) has agreed to support [**Datryllic**](https://datryllic.com/) in pursuing several of the advancements we listed, including:
- [performance improvements for making use of whole-network analysis results]({{< ref "/opportunities/alchemiscale-2025#analysis-bottlenecks" >}})
- [server-side memory of compute services that consistently fail jobs]({{< ref "/opportunities/alchemiscale-2025#server-side-memory-of-compute-services-that-consistently-fail-jobs" >}})
- [ability to merge and copy AlchemicalNetworks server-side]({{< ref "/opportunities/alchemiscale-2025#merging-and-copying-alchemicalnetworks-server-side" >}})
- [a supported mechanism for expanding living AlchemicalNetworks with new protein structures]({{< ref "/opportunities/alchemiscale-2025#expanding-living-alchemicalnetworks-with-new-protein-structures" >}})
- [host provenance information from successful and failed ProtocolDAGResults]({{< ref "/opportunities/alchemiscale-2025#host-provenance" >}})

[**Datryllic**](https://datryllic.com/) will also continue to make robustness improvements to [Folding@Home-based execution](https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/alchemiscale-fah) over the course of 2025.
